# CapðŸª¨NFT Marketplace (Final Year Project by Group B54)

NFTs are taking the digital art and collectibles work by storm. Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to huge sales to a new audience. They are used to represent ownership of any unique asset, like a deed for an item in the digital or physical realm.

Our project is a completely decentralized web3 application or DApp deployed on the ethereum blockchain. It is an NFT marketplace where users can buy, mint and sell artwork. Everything is decentralized, even the uploaded files are stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) which is a p2p network.
